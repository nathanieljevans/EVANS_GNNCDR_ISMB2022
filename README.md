Ineffective or limited precision oncology treatments are a cause of patient mortality. We seek to address this challenge by improving pre-clinical drug repurposing and drug combination discovery. We highlight the methodological challenge of training drug response models using single-drug data that will generalize well to multi-drug perturbations. We operate on the premise that protein-protein interactions mediate cellular drug response and hypothesize that incorporating this prior knowledge in a deep learning framework is liable to overcome limitations in drug response modeling. To do this we propose a machine learning model to predict drug-perturbed mRNA expression from intrinsic cancer features using graph neural networks (GNN) that operate on literature curated protein functional-interactions and drug-target interactions. We have shown promise of our approach using synthetic data and are in-progress of applying it to experimental datasets (LINCS L1000). The successful outcome of our method will enable novel GNN-based approaches to drug prioritization.
